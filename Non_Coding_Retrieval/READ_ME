Purpose:
non-coding sequence retrieval surrounding a gene or sequence of interest
from large genomic scaffolds. 

This script uses BLAST, so the  exact location of the gene is not required. 
Because there may be multiple matching HSPs (high scoring segment pairs) 
produced by BLAST for each gene of interest, this script outputs all HSPs of a 
minimum percent similarity (provided by the user).

Prerequisites:
ncd_run.py requires ncdmodules.py in the same directory
this script also requires Biopython and ncbi-blast+

Usage:
python ncd_run.py genes_of_interest_file.fasta \
	Large_genomic_file.fasta min_perc_similarity

NOTE: percent similarity is written without "%"
percent similarity represents the similarity of the HSP produced by BLAST

Example:
python ncd_run.py protocadherinBs.fasta human_scaffolds.fasta 90

Output:
Three fasta files per genomic region of interest: *_upstream.fasta, 
*_downstream.fasta, and *_fullseq.fasta
*=These files are named after the genomic scaffold queried, so a brief name in
the fastafile will be desired, i.e. >CHR1, >CHR2, >scaffold34234, etc.

The sequences in fasta format are named after the corresponding matching gene, 
the percent similarity to that gene, and the location of the gene (based on the
scaffold queried)

example:
>protocadherinB-1|99%|1600000
ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATG
