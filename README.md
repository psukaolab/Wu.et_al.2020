# Sequence Analysis of the *Petunia* *S*-locus Containing 17 *S-Locus F-box* Genes of Self-Incompatibility (Wu et al.,2020)
Customized scripts for data analysis for Wu et al. (2020). 

Script descriptions:


TE_Density/: Customized scripts used for calculation of transposable element (TE) density, which is determined by the average number of TE per kb region over a 2,500 bp sliding window size using transposable elements predicted by RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 2015). These scripts is used for making Figure 1E. 

Multiple_Exon_Gene/: Customized scripts used for retrevial of multiple exon *F-box* genes and their gene structrues in the *S<sub>6a</sub>* genome of *Petunia inflata*. This script is used in the workflow in Supplemental Figure 8B. 

Non_Coding_Retrieval/: Customized scripts used for retrevial of non-coding (upstream and downstream) flanking region sequences of *SLF* genes  that were used for phylogenetic and sequence comparative analysis in this study. A READ_ME file is attached to explain the usage of this script.
